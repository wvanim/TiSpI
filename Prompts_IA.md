# TiSpI - Time/Space Invariant
### Arbre strict d'alternance Temps / Espace pour UI prévisibles

TiSpI describes what appears on screen and evolves over time.
Unlike other approaches, everything follows a single, simple logic—like a clock and its gears.

*40 years of experience in interface state machines.*

## QUESTIONING THE AI

The first three prompts present TiSpI as interpreted by the AI.
The next four prompts assess how compatible it is with AI systems.

### **1st prompt for your Artificial Intelligence**

* place the 2 images 'tree diagram' and 'piece / timeline / tracks diagram'

* write:

```
Analyze and evaluate this format for a fixed or animated software page component.
```

- Tree diagram

- Piece / timeline / tracks diagram
<img width="1138" height="753" alt="im32" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b44cd8c-ffbc-4a52-bc35-f53ffa33f514" />

### **2nd prompt**

* write:

```
Evaluate with the "comment" flag for a piece, added in 2007

Role: prevent the piece from being sent to the run-time. The piece stays in the editor.

Consequence:
The piece's action can be used for the editor itself => it becomes a macro-piece... A control, in fact.

Since the piece is in a group, we can assign a role to the group. Example: button.
The tree is modular, so we can move the entire branch of this group + the macro-pieces will follow since they are part of the tree branch.
=> export => place in an online library.
=> the comment flag, by itself, created the mechanism for building parameterizable library templates.

Some actions will allow automatic editing of a sub-group.
Example for the "animated button" template => 3 buttons will allow direct editing of each group for each button state.

I was already exporting groups from the start. I quickly understood the tree was modular. So macro-pieces followed naturally in 2007.

---

The dashboard is itself a macro-group. Meaning the dashboard is integrated into the tree.

Furthermore, an option allows creating it with only one piece present when the program opens.
It is a macro-piece.
Through moving, resizing, and programming, the user commands it to create each element of the editor.
```

### **3rd prompt**

* place the 2 images 'user command bar' and 'command bar construction'
- User command bar
[[![im6](https://github.com/wvanim/TiSpI/blob/main/im33.png)
](https://github.com/wvanim/TiSpI/commit/534c017b1776b7379f83bb843f1115d2e70f8824)

- Command bar construction
[[![im6](https://github.com/wvanim/TiSpI/blob/main/im34.png)
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wvanim/TiSpI/refs/heads/main/im34.png)

* write:

```
Example of a user command bar.
I call gadget authors "designers". But they are also simple users.
Image 1: what the end user sees, who uses the "video overlay" gadget
- a classic work area, and an editing bar on the right.
Image 2: the sub-group where the designer builds the command bar
- adds pieces "like the others" (note: they can even place gadgets from other designers)
- programs the scripts that will act in the editor.

Note: protections and shortcuts are not shown here. We are only discussing the structure.
What matters is understanding the limits of the structure. The editor can always optimize and apply protections.
```

### **4th prompt**

* write:

```
The description format is a tabint tree accompanied by the string table (assembler model).
Could this design facilitate AI processing?
```

---

### **5th prompt**

* write:

```
Could this format be an interesting solution as a standard for exchanging HTML with the AI?
1 - convert React to TiSpI before sending it to the prompt
2 - use a traditional script and a local AI.
```

---

### **6th prompt**

* write:

```
Can you estimate an order of magnitude for the economy in conversions from React and HTML to TiSpI for prompts?
Note: calculate with optimized React, HTML, and TiSpI formats.
```
---

### **7th prompt**

* write:

```
We are observing the emergence of automated HTML page compositions, for selected product catalogs or AI-generated page layouts.
Could the TiSpI format play a role in this process?
```

---

### Addendum

This is an introduction. E-anim / WvAnim has been evolving for 25 years within a structure unchanged since its origin.

Also, these prompts are not an exhaustive list of the fundamental TiSpI optimizations resulting from the rigor of the model.
